## A Few Notes

**Q: Corals?**

A: Yes. Bonemeal the ocean floors and enjoy. Check the wiki.

**Q: Will this work with Ordana's [Logical Dye Mixing](https://modrinth.com/datapack/logical-dye-mixing)?**

A: It should. There's one overlapping recipe, though, but it shouldn't be a problem (the result is the same).

\___

**Mod suggestion:** Pandarix' [Bushier Flowers](https://modrinth.com/mod/bushier-flowers) (because it makes harvesting dyes much easier. Also it looks pretty cool.)

Tested with Fabric API 0.92.0+1.20.1

This mod is provided "as is". It should technically work on all 1.20.X versions of the game. I am not planning to update/backport this mod to a different version of Minecraft. You're free to do so yourself, however.
